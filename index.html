      <p class="content">
        My name is Clara, and I was born in Suceava, Romania in 1928 and I'm a holocaust survivor.<br/>
        When I was 10 years old, on Sukkot holiday, the romanian military which was an accomplice of the Nazis, came to our house and took me and my family.<br/>
        We took little food and cloths, just what we could carry, and aboarded on trains which took us to Mogilev on the Romania-Russia border, then we walked on foot all the way to Lucenec, Slovakia.<br/>
        My father, who worked in trading, was able to earn some money, which he used to bring us back to Mogilev.<br/>
        We stayed there until the Russian military conquered the city and free us from the Nazi regime.<br/>
        In 1951, me and my family finally moved to Israel and lived in the "Maabarot" here.<br/>
        Those were difficult times but we did manage.<br/>
        I met my husband Abraham here and married him in 1952.<br/>
        Today, I live in Rehovot, after I grew a family here on 2 children, 6 grandschildren and 8 great-grandchild.<br/>
        I love to sew, cook and listen to Romanian and Idish music.<br/>

        - Web2 search engines could also find micro content, like pics, audio, video, links and more... <br/>
        - Web3 search engines could do more, and find more content by analyzing part of the ambiguity by homonyms, synonyms and general context<br/>

        User Story: Searching for a disease<br/>
        On web1 we would only find pages with general information about the disease. The most common pages would be such that the word of the disease appeared most in.<br/>
        On web2 we could also find blogs and community pages of people that share their knowledge about it, videos and pictures... <br/>
        More over, the result for general information would be more accurate and we can expand our query for better results for our use (like "disease-name side-affects")<br/>
        On web3 we would also receive a SaaS app that provide us platform to make an online appointment with a special doctor.
