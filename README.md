This website is about my fiancee's grandmother - Clara Fogel.
Clara is a 94 years old holocaust survivor from Romania who lives happily in Rehovot, Israel.

Important notes about the website:
The "About me", "My Photos", "My Playlist" sections headers are collapsible buttons which have to by pressed to watch the content under it.
